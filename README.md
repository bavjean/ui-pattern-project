# Find New Recipes

This project was to use an API to populate a web page. I chose to do it in a slider format so you can slide back and forth between the recipes chosen randomly by the API.

## Getting Started

1. The live page can be found here OR
2. Fork and clone the repository
3. Navigate to new directory and load HTML in browser

## Prerequisites

Web browser and/or text editor
